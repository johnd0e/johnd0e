# üëã Hi there, I'm johnd0e!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
    
I'm passionate about technology, coding, and open source.  
I currently have [>100'000](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Ajohnd0e+&type=commits) commits on GitHub.

Though most if them come from numerous forks of my recent project [**openai-gemini**](/PublicAffairs/openai-gemini), which turned out to be unexpectedly popular :smirk:.
