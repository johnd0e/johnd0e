# üëã Hi there, I'm johnd0e!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
    
I'm passionate about technology, coding, and open-source.  
I currently have [`>100'000`](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Ajohnd0e+&type=commits) commits on GitHub.
Though most of them come from numerous forks of my recent project [**openai-gemini**](/PublicAffairs/openai-gemini), which turned out to be unexpectedly popular :smirk:.
